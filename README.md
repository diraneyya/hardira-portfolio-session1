# Hari's Playground

## Intro
The playground is a collection of experimental projects for learning purposes. It is such a lively space that is contatnly chnaging and evolving. It started in early September with super simple projects to experiment with simple JavaScript functionality and now towards the end of October, more advanced, high quality portfolio projects are being added already. Projects that have a database and gives a friendly interface for the end user to edit that database (facilitating CRUD operations through a friendly interface).

## Next Steps
The next step (target date being the end of November), the main projects here are going to be nicely and professionaly fleshed (currently they're just bare bones and they don't look niceâ€”yet).
