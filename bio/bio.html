    <h3>Your Favorite Front End Developer</h3>
    <p>
      Many moons ago I casually started working on a game just to have fun. Soon
      though, that experiment turned into an actual commercial project and
      Joyfess was born. Five years later,
      <a href="https://joyfess.com/" target="_blank">Joyfess</a> was published
      on Steam. Although later what I would do was not game development but
      rather web fron-end, it was that experience that started it all. I knew I
      loved develoment, and I never looked back!
    </p>
    <p>
      Today I'm a junior fornt end developer on a journey to learn more and more
      about HTML, JavaScript, CSS and React.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not developing, you will probably find me on dancefloor dancing
      Salsa and Bachata.
