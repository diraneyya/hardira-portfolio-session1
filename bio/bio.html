    <h3>My Story with Coding</h3>
    <p>
      Some people have started to code young they don't even remember when it
      first occured to them; others might have had more of an aha-moment when
      they discovered their love for code. For me, that realization came to me
      when I somehow ended up developing my own PC game
      <a href="https://joyfess.com/" target="_blank">Joyfess</a> (now how that
      happened is a story for another day). I fell in love with coding! At the
      time, I was a project manager at a reputable multi-national organization
      and very content with my job and the amazing work culture. But eventually
      I did quit my job to enroll in masters of business analytics and
      information systems in the University of South Florida. For many that was
      for the sake of data science; for me, it was a stepping stone to shift
      into software engineering (it worked pretty well with the big overlap
      between the two worlds).

      Today I'm a junior fornt end developer on a journey to learn more and more
      about HTML, JavaScript, CSS and React.
