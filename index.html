      Welcome to my playground, stranger! You have reached my experimentation
      space. It's mainly for me trying out new things, but it is also a kind of
      a "public learning" excercise. Feel free to stick around - I add comments
      to pretty much everything around here!

      The I-Don't-See-You and Hovering pages were created to play around with
      click and hovering event listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Tables page, I'm experimenting with CSS styles tables. In that
      page, we pretend data is fetched from the backend using JavaScript, that
      is to say, data is not hard-coded into the HTML document but is imported
      as an object.

      ToDo is a mini-program that creates your own to-do list. It is under construction as of 28.09.2022.
